      <h1>The Beauty of Git</h1>
      <p>
        At first, there was nothing. And then Linus Torvalds created Linux.
        <br />
        And Linus saw it was good. The second day, he created Git.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Git</h2>
      <p>
        When thinking about modern Software Engineering, it is impossible not to
        think of Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        For anyone who does not know git already: Git is a distributed Version
        Control System (VCS). It allows you to track changes you make to your
        code (or any other files for that matter), roll them back and view your
        project at each state it previously had. Git also allows you to create
        something called branches, lightweight deviations from the main codebase
        to try something out or implement a new feature without disrupting the
        work of those working in the main codebase.
